Requirements:
	- extended cppStats (https://github.com/clhunsen/cppstats)

HowTo:
	1. Download the extended cppStats from github
	2. Copy the path to the source parent folder (the source files have to be in a source folder) to "cppstats_input.txt" in the cppstats folder
	3. Run cppStats in a terminal with the 'featurelocations' and 'general' options
		--> ./cppstats.py --kind 'featurelocations'
		--> ./cppstats.py --kind 'general'
	4. Run the program. The following arguments are possible and define which processes are done during runtime
		--source [Path/To/A/CppStatsResult/Folder]
		--processed [Path/To/A/ProcessedData/Folder]
		--config [Path/To/A/CodeSmellConfiguration.file]
		--SaveIntermediate
		
Examples:
	--source examplePath --saveintermediate
		The cppstats and SrcMl files will be processed and the processed data will be saved to the working directory
	
	--source examplePath --saveintermediate --config examplePath2
		The cppstats and SrcML files will be processed and saved to the working directoy for later used.
		Afterwards the detection will be performed with the given configuration. A result file will be saved to the working directory.
		
	--processed examplePath --config examplePath2
		Previously processed data will be loaded and the detection process will be performed afterwards. A result file will be saved to the working directory.
